A simple adventure game by Daniel Shim based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Road, Lobby, Room, Evidence.
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, Outro.
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: simpleObj (create a simple object which only has a pointover text).
    - Enhancement 2: setTheme (simplified method to change background color with hex colors).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Road, Lobby, Room, Evidence.
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Key in Lobby, Bed in Room.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Tree in Road, Tv in Room.
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Key in Lobby, Bed in Room.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Suspect in Evidence.
